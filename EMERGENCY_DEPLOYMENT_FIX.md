# 🚨 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
Your Streamlit Cloud app is failing because **yfinance** is not installing properly. This is a common issue with Streamlit Cloud and Python 3.13 compatibility.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Automated Fix
```bash
python deploy_emergency_fix.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix
1. **Replace app.py** with ultra-minimal version:
   ```bash
   cp app_ultra_minimal.py app.py
   ```

2. **Replace requirements.txt** with minimal version:
   ```bash
   cp requirements-ultra-minimal.txt requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Emergency fix: Ultra-minimal version"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 📋 What This Fix Does
